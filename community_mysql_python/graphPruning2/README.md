# GraphPruning
Package for "pruning" weighted complex networks based on the Marginal Likelihood Filter.

# Overview
When dealing with weighted complex networks of dyadic relationships between nodes, we frequently encounter overly-dense "hairball" networks where the large number of edges may obfuscate the most important structures within the graph. 

People often "prune" the graph by simply setting a threshold on the edge weights and removing all edges below the threshold. However, this simplistic approach systematically disfavours low-degree nodes and the structures they represent.Therefore, we need to measure the significance of an edge, with respect to the degrees of its incident vertices. 

Here, we do this using a version of the configuration model as our null model that defines what we expect an edge’s weight to be given its end-nodes’ degrees. The null model predicts a probability distribution for the value of the edge weight. By comparing the observed weight of an edge with this predicted distribution, we can then compute a p-value which tells us how surprising the observed value is given the null model. This p-value gives us a measure of the statistical significance of the edge, and we can filter the edges according to this significance rather than the raw weight itself.
# How to use the package
```python
import igraph as ig
from pruning import unimodal
import numpy as np
```

```python
# Create a graph with random integer weights
g = ig.Graph.Barabasi(1000,3)
g.es['weight'] = np.random.randint(1,40, g.ecount())

# Get the edgelist dataframe with columns
# ['source', 'target', 'weight']
df = g.get_edge_dataframe()

# Instantiate an MFL object and compute
# the edge significance 
mlf = unimodal.MLF(directed=False)
G = mlf.fit_transform(g)
df_edgelist_1 = G.get_edge_dataframe()

# New edge attribute "significance" is created
# ['weight', 'significance']
print(G.es.attributes())

# Apply the transformer to the edgelist
# dataframe of the graph
mlf = unimodal.MLF(directed=False)
df_edgelist_2 = mlf.fit_transform(df)


# df_edgelist_1 and df_edgelist_2 are "equivalent"
```
