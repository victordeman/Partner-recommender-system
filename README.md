Based on machine learning and different Personality questionnaires which are close to the Five Factor Model or Big-Five, the grouping of students is carried out. The project workflow contains code to extract all personality questionnaire responses of students from mysql database, pre-process the data and create student groups for single layer and multiplex (multi-layer) networks through Leiden Community Detection algorithm which will be used for recommending study partners to students.
